# DOCKER CONTAINER FOR PINTOS
## MADE FOR LABS OF EDA093 IN CHALMERS
## BASED ON YHPARK/PINTOS-KAIS

## Step 1

Open powershell as admin (best to work in ie. conemu, simple powershell has bad colors for bash of docker container)

## Step Next 

Do set shared dir, docker pull and run as in help below. If exit from container,
connecto to it with start as below. If want to refresh container, remove it and then
run again. Its not possible to copy files to shared dir (with -v) during run,
they had to be copied later (or in smart way I dont know yey)

```powershell
#first set directory on host that will be shared with container as workspace
Set-Variable -Name WSP -Value E:\PintOS\workspace
# to pull from docker
docker pull robgrzel/pintos
docker run -it --privileged --name pintos-container --dns=8.8.8.8 -v $WSP:/home/pintos/workspace -P robgrzel/pintos /bin/bash

# after exit if want to connect again
## manually with getting id first
docker ps -a 
docker start -ia pintos 
## or in one line
docker start -ia (docker ps -a | grep pintos | awk '{print $1;}')

# to remove image or container
docker rm (docker ps -a | grep pintos | awk '{print $1;}')
docker rmi (docker ps -a | grep pintos | awk '{print $1;}')


# if in dev change, ie. of dockerfile, to push to docker hub
docker login
docker tag pintos robgrzel/pintos
docker push robgrzel/pintos

```
